C# Coding Challenge

Please send a C# file containing a function that achieves the following:
o	A string parameter is passed to the function – attached are various samples of possible input data
o	The function receives this data as a string, not an array, json or other data formats
o	The function should parse the string and mask sensitive data.
o	Sensitive data should be masked (replaced) with an Asterix (*) character.
o	Sensitive data includes the fields below, but new sensitive fields should be easily added to the function as needed:
	The credit card number
	The credit card expiry date
	The credit card CVV value
o	The function returns the parsed string in the same format that it was provided, but with the sensitive data now masked.
